## Myntra Recommendation System
Myntra is one of India's leading online fashion and lifestyle retailers. A critical feature of its platform is its product recommendation system, which aims to enhance the user experience by suggesting relevant products based on user behavior, ratings. Incorporating images into the recommendation system can significantly improve its accuracy and relevance. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at the system:

## Problem Statement
Users often find it difficult to discover products that match their preferences, leading to lower engagement and conversion rates. Seamlessly integrating the recommendation system into the user interface without disrupting the user experience can be challenging.By addressing these problem statements, Myntra can significantly enhance its recommendation system, providing users with a more personalized and engaging shopping experience, ultimately driving higher conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

## Solution
## Image-Based Recommendation :

Visual Similarity: Utilizing image processing and computer vision techniques to recommend products that visually resemble the items the user has shown interest in. This can be particularly useful in fashion, where the visual appeal is crucial.

Deep Learning Models: Implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and understand the visual features of products, enabling more sophisticated and accurate image-based recommendations.

## Product Recommendation System :

Collaborative Filtering: This involves recommending products based on the similarities between users or items. If User A likes Product X, and User B likes Product X, it is likely that User A might also like the other products that User B likes.

Content-Based Filtering: This approach recommends products that are similar to what the user has liked or viewed in the past. It relies on product features like category, brand, color, and other attributes.
